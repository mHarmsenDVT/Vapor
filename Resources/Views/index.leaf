            RoundTrip is an iOS application designed to help the public be safe,
by avoiding high crime zones.
Whether you're buying a new home or on your daily drive home this app will allow you to identify which areas to avoid and which areas are more safe.
This app is particulary designed for travelers who are unfamiliar with which areas are suitable for walking and which are not.
This app allows other users to report incidents and advise others on what would and would not be suitable.
For example, walk through Parktown in the evening is particulary dangerous.
